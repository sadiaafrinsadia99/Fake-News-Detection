# Fake-News-Detection
This project was developed for NSDC - HerWILL Data Science Contest, this machine learning-based solution classifies news articles as real or fake. 
This project will create a fake news detection model to classify a given news article as real or fake. Fake News Detection leverages both Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning skills - how to represent text in a machine-understandable format so as to classify the text and extract whether a news is fake or real. We will also cover visualizations and how to deploy models in the real world.
